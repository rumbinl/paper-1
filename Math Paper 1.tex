\section{Abstract}
We devise a polynomial-complexity algorithm for finding a hamiltonian cycle in a semi-lattice graphs, and establish the criteria for its devisability. Hamiltonian Cycles f

\section{Definitions}
We define a graph as a set $G=\lbrace V,E \rbrace$. $V$ is the set of vertices. $E$ is the set of edges. For an edge $e\in E, V_{x},V_{y}\in V, e=\lbrace V_{x},V_{y} \rbrace $ A graph can be represented with a drawing.
