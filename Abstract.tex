\section{Abstract}
This paper identifies a visual property of boundaries of right-angled walls, found in the video game Pacman, where corners are rounded and walls are straight and clamped in alignment with the normal of the path which they face. The walls form a closed boundary. The 2-dimensional gridded nature of wall placement allows them to be represented using a square lattice graph. With the aim of finding the direction towards which they are clamped, so as to recreate the visual properties of the walls in Pacman, we devise a polynomial-complexity algorithm for finding a hamiltonian cycle in square-lattice subgraphs, and establish criteria for its devisability.
