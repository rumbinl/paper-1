\section{Abstract}
This paper identifies a visual property of boundaries of right-angled walls, found in the video game Pac-Man, where corners are rounded and walls are straight and oriented towards with the normal of the path which they face, and connected to neighbouring walls. The walls form a closed boundary. The 2-dimensional gridded nature of wall placement allows them to be represented using a square lattice graph. With the aim of finding the direction towards which they are clamped, so as to recreate the visual properties of the walls in Pac-Man, we devise a polynomial-complexity algorithm for finding a hamiltonian cycle in square-lattice subgraphs. The algorithm will be tested in a program written by the author in the C and Objective C programming language, deriving the resultant image demonstrating the algorithm's outcome.
